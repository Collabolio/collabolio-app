<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


The name "Collabolio" is a portmanteau of the words "Collaboration" and "Portfolio". The word "Collaboration" represents the focus of the platform on teamwork and cooperation, while "Portfolio" represents the end goal of creating a showcase of one's skills and accomplishments. The combination of these two words in the name "Collabolio" represents the platform's goal to facilitate collaboration among users for the purpose of creating high-quality portfolios.

The main scope of this project is to develop an Android-based social-collaborative platform that uses matchmaking-based algorithms to help college graduates in Indonesia improve their teamwork and collaboration skills, with a focus on portfolio creation.
